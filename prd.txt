This project will be used as a wedding website for Dana and Jaicob. It must
accomplish the following

Pages: Add templates for the following content pages
- Password page
- Home
- Our Story
- Travel
- Schedule
- Registry

In addition to these pages it must have the following features
- Password protected, ideally done without external services or api calls but
  also must not expose the password in the static files
- Build as a statically generated website that can be hosted on s3, github
  pages, or similar platforms.
- Ideally use tailwind css, the latest version, with a placeholder for
  overriding the theme (fonts, colors) fonts will use local files
- Localization support for english (default) and korean via separate language
  files
- Use smooth and elegant animations/transitions for lazy loading images, text
  scrolling into the viewport, and transitioning between pages. It should not be
so slow that it makes using the site feel sluggish though.

Below is more guidance on each page

Password Page
- Should be simple and elegant and upon entering the password provide a unique
  transition to the Home page. Suggestion -- a logo for the couple in the
center, an input line below for the password. Upon correct password entry the
logo transitions upwards to the header, menu expands out and the couples names
appear in the center of the screen, more to be shown on scroll.

Home page
- Contains the date, location, countdown timer till the event, a message from
  the couple, and a link to RSVP  It should use a unique, artistic layout but
not one that makes it too hard to find the info you need. It should have a
mysterious feel to it that builds anticipation.

Our Story
- I want to keep this relativel short and sweet, but also artistic, assume there
  will be an image or some drawings that have hotspots, hovering on these
hotspots or individually graphics will reveal a section of our story. As each
piece of the story is interacted with a key is formed. Upon completion this key
opens a chest that shares some words of wisdom we will provide which we feel
captures our love.

Travel
- This is a utilitarian page which prioritizes access to information,
  recommended flights, the main hotel and how to book, alternative hotels in the
area, when we recommend arriving and leaving.

Schedule
- Also simple and more utilitarian it will show important times for the day-of

Resgistry
- No integrations needed here, it will just be a message from the couple and a
  link out to another platform.

Our main colors are:
Background:#f0ecdf
Foreground:#342412
Accent:#2352b8
All other theme colors should be based on these prefer shades and variations to
create contrast where needed instead of introducing more hues.
